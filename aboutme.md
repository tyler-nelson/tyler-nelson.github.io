Hi I'm Tyler. This is my first project using markdown and HTML so please excuse the under construction nature of this site. I like problem solving. Whether it's a geometry proof or an optimization problem I am happy to work on them.

# Work & Education
I'm working on my PhD in astronomy at the University of Texas at Austin. My current work is split into Solar System and Galatic Archeology where I study these systems to understand more about star systems and galaxies. Currently, I use high resolution spectroscopy of comets and stars to understand the Solar System and Galaxy respectively. 

I went to the University of Southern Maine for undergrad. I graduated with a majors in Physics & Math with minors in Chemistry & Computer Science. 

# Hobbies
I program and play games in my free time. When the weather permits I enjoy going on hikes and site seeing. I am slowly working my way through project Euler. I've finished the first page, albeit with some pretty inelegant solutions. I have recently finished my first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3 and found it to be enjoyable inspite of its early access shortcomings. During the COVID quarintine I've been visiting the state parks in Maine with my Mom. We have visited a majority of the parks at or below Acadia.
